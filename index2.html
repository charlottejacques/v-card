		<h2 class="text text--h2">I'm a web designer student</h2>

		<p class="text text--p">I will not talk about me in the third person because I’m still not famous or gifted enough. No I’m kidding, it’s just that I don’t like that so I’ll talk about myself in the first person like a normal human being.</br></br>

		I’m living in Gembloux, it’s a lonely town in the district of Namur, Belgium. I’m 20 years old (if you read that later, I was 20 in 2016) and I didn’t do anything of my life yet but I’ll catch up later, I promise.</br>

		I spend my time doing sports, especially basketball, with my family, taking photographs. But with my studies I discovered a new hobby, I love coding, designing websites, doing layouts for the print and typography. It became obvious that I had to work in this environment.</br> 

		I’m a rational person but with the head in the stars. I’m also a team player, a very sociable and creative woman. I’m able to make decisions, good decisions, under pressure and I’m not scared easily. In everyday life I'm clumsy and daredevil.</br></br> 

		Was I born with an ace in the hole??? I don’t really know, maybe it’s my joie de vivre or my creativity, my self-mockery and my sense of humour. I have a lot of capacities and qualities but also a lot of weaknesses. So I think that my ace in the hole is I, many things that built together make me what I am.</br></br> 

		Do I have future desire concerning Web design??? Yes I want to work in web design or graphic design but I’ll be honest with you, I don’t really have a plan for my future career. For now I live day by day with my friends and my family. Sure, if I have to write this text again in a few years, my plans will be different. But for now I prefer no to think too much about it.</p>
